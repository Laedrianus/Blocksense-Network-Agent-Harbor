# Blocksense Network Agent Harbor GUI Wizard

This is a web-based wizard to simplify the setup and management of Agent Harbor and its integrated AI agents like OpenHands.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To make getting started as easy as possible, you can use the provided scripts to install dependencies and launch the development server with a single click or command.

### On Windows

Simply double-click the `start.bat` file.

A command prompt window will open, install the necessary dependencies (if it's your first time running it), and then start the development server.

### On macOS or Linux

1.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
2.  First, you need to make the script executable. You only need to do this once:
    ```sh
    chmod +x start.sh
    ```
3.  Now, you can run the project anytime with:
    ```sh
    ./start.sh
    ```

The script will handle installing dependencies and starting the server.

Once the server is running, the script will display the local URL. You can access the wizard in your web browser, typically at **`http://localhost:5173`**.
